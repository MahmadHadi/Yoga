          <h2>Hatha Yoga:</h2>
          <div class="text">
            Hatha Yoga is one of the oldest and most widely practiced forms of
            yoga. It is a holistic system that focuses on physical postures
            (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation. The word
            "hatha" is derived from the Sanskrit words "ha" meaning "sun" and
            "tha" meaning "moon," which represent the balance of opposing forces
            in the body. The practice of Hatha Yoga is designed to help balance
            the body and mind, and promote physical and mental well-being. It is
            great for beginners and those looking for a slower-paced practice.
            Hatha Yoga is also known for its ability to help reduce stress and
            anxiety, improve flexibility and balance, and increase strength and
            endurance. In addition to the physical benefits, Hatha Yoga also has
            many spiritual benefits. It can help you connect with your inner
            self, increase your awareness and consciousness, and promote a sense
            of peace and well-being. If you are interested in practicing Hatha
            Yoga, there are many resources available to help you get started.
            You can find classes at local yoga studios or community centers, or
            you can practice at home using online videos or books. When
            practicing Hatha Yoga, it is important to listen to your body and
            work at your own pace. Remember to breathe deeply and stay present
            in the moment. Namaste! üôè

          <h2>Vinyasa Yoga:</h2>
          <div class="text">
            Vinyasa Yoga is a dynamic and invigorating style that places a
            strong emphasis on the harmonious coordination of breath and
            movement. The term "vinyasa" signifies a special way of linking
            these elements in a continuous and flowing sequence of yoga poses.
            Each movement is carefully synchronized with either an inhalation or
            exhalation, creating a seamless and rhythmic flow. Vinyasa classes
            often involve a variety of poses, ranging from foundational standing
            postures to inversions and backbends. The transitions between poses
            are as integral as the poses themselves, fostering a graceful and
            dance-like quality to the practice. This style encourages creativity
            and variety, allowing instructors the flexibility to design unique
            sequences, making each class a dynamic and engaging experience. The
            breath-centered movement not only enhances physical strength,
            flexibility, and balance but also promotes mindfulness and a
            meditative state, making Vinyasa Yoga a holistic and energizing
            practice for both body and mind.

          <h2>Ashtanga Yoga:</h2>
          <div class="text">
            Ashtanga Yoga, established by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, is a dynamic and
            systematic practice that centers around a predetermined sequence of
            postures, notably the Primary Series or Yoga Chikitsa. Characterized
            by the integration of breath and movement, practitioners navigate a
            challenging flow of asanas, connected by vinyasas, fostering
            internal heat and enhancing physical strength and flexibility. The
            structured nature of Ashtanga, coupled with an emphasis on
            consistent practice, instills discipline and cultivates a meditative
            experience. Beyond being a physical endeavor, Ashtanga Yoga serves
            as a transformative journey, promoting a holistic connection between
            body, breath, and mind, ultimately facilitating self-discovery and
            mindfulness on and off the mat.

            Iyengar Yoga, founded by B.K.S. Iyengar, is renowned for its
            meticulous approach to alignment and precision in yoga postures.
            This method places a strong emphasis on the use of props such as
            blocks, belts, and bolsters to assist practitioners in achieving
            optimal alignment and to adapt the practice to individual needs.
            Each pose is held for an extended period, allowing for a deep
            exploration of the body and an increased awareness of alignment. The
            practice is systematic, with a progressive sequencing of asanas
            designed to enhance strength, flexibility, and balance. Iyengar Yoga
            is accessible to practitioners of all levels, and its therapeutic
            applications make it particularly beneficial for individuals
            recovering from injuries or with specific physical conditions.
            Beyond the physical aspect, Iyengar Yoga also incorporates pranayama
            (breath control) and meditation, fostering a holistic approach to
            well-being and self-discovery. The method's attention to detail and
            focus on alignment make it a transformative and adaptable practice
            for individuals seeking precision and depth in their yoga journey.

          <h2>Ashtanga Yoga:</h2>
          <div class="text">
            Bikram Yoga, popularly known as Hot Yoga, is a specific style
            created by Bikram Choudhury involving a series of 26 postures and
            two breathing exercises performed in a room heated to high
            temperatures. The heat, maintained around 105¬∞F (40.6¬∞C), is
            believed to increase flexibility, stimulate circulation, and aid in
            detoxification through profuse sweating. Each Bikram class follows
            the same sequence, targeting various muscle groups with an emphasis
            on deep stretching and strengthening. The controlled environment
            aims to prt injuries and allows practitioners to experience
            heightened physical challenges and mental focus. While the intense
            heat might not be suitable for everyone, enthusiasts appreciate the
            potential benefits of improved flexibility, increased endurance, and
            a unique, invigorating yoga experience. Critics, however, highlight
            concerns about safety in extreme heat conditions and emphasize the
            importance of proper hydration and individual adaptation to the
            practice.
